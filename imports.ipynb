    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into imports, let's discuss some terminology: Modules, Libraries & Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Module** is a Python file that contains collections of functions and global variables. It is an executable file with a .py extension. A module can exist in: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Base python (https://docs.python.org/3/library/). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Community developed packages (https://pypi.org/), \n",
    "\n",
    "- Your working directory as a file that you have created. For example, Darden student Bethany Thompson has a repository named 'Predicting-Diabetes-Onset' (https://github.com/ThompsonBethany01/Predicting-Diabetes-Onset). It contains a file named Prepare.py, which is a module she created that she imports in her 'Data_Analysis.ipynb' Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **Library** is \"a collection of related functionality of codes that allows you to perform many tasks without writing your code. It is a reusable chunk of code that we can use by importing it in our program.\" [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-difference-between-pythons-module-package-and-library/) Next week, we will introduce you to the most awesome library ever ;)...Pandas. In fact, Pandas is a module, a library AND a package. https://pandas.pydata.org/. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Package** is a directory having collections of modules. It can also consist of other packages, or 'sub-packages'. It is a way to distribute one or more modules. We *install* packages in order to be able to *import* modules or libraries for use. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python Package Index (PyPI, https://pypi.org/) is a repository of community developed Python packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Anaconda's **Conda** product is a package manager. It helps you find and install packages (that originate in PyPI). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "______________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can only **import** the **libraries and modules** of **packages** that have already been **installed**! In other words, in order to import a library or a module we have to install a package that contains it. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main sources from imports:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The [Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). This comes with the Python language, and no special installation is needed in order to use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. 3rd party packages. These require installation either through `conda` or `pip`. You can use `pip install` (*Package in Python*) to install packages directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). You can use `conda install` to install packages through Anaconda's Conda package manager. \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Our own code. We can break our code into separate files and use imports to use code from one file in another. This would be stored in the same directory as the files that would import them. *These do not require installation.*"

Anaconda vets the packages available for safety and reliability. On the other hand, PyPI is commumity developed, so it is very easy for malicious code to be contributed and exist for a bit before it is caught and pulled down. Because of that, it is important to pay close attention to what you are installing. Check the followers, supports, downloads of a package before you install it. You don't want to install a package that is new or not well known, unless you have fully vetted the code and know what it is doing. To see the code, you can visit the github repo for each package."
